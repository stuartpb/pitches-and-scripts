# Silicon Valley plot pitch: Venture Capitalist Optimization

This is the idea I originally made this repo for. It's also the subject of a long conversation I had last night, one that danced around so much of this crap in that perfectly bald-faced-yet-still-dishonest fashion you only find with Silicon Valley (the show *and* the real-life one).

The genesis of this conversation started with me describing how dumb Search Engine Optimization was, and he we'd blanch at something as blatantly focused on "teaching the test" in other fields. The example I came up with was "Venture Capitalist Optimization" instead of actually refining a business strategy to be *fiscally sound*, but then someone pointed out that that sounds like something you'd see in Silicon Valley, and at that point the scene kind of just started falling out of my fingers naturally.
