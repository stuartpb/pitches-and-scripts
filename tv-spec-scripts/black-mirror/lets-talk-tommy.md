# Let's Talk Tommy (working title)

Okay, so, the origins of this idea lie in this kind of recurring nightmare / hallucination I get sometimes, about the chromosones of my sperm being data directly compiled by my subconscious. This fear compounds with one of my other (normally largely rational) fears, that of shipping code with a design flaw that can't be patched for reasons of backward compatibility (like the origins of JavaScript).

After waking up in a cold sweat with the imagery of this fresh in my mind this morning, I also recalled a couple of other thoughts I've had percolating in my head, one based on the new season that premiered December 29 and one I've thought would make an interesting Black Mirror theme for years:

- I want to revisit the characters from *USS Callister* to hint at how they all turned out, even if it's just a background reference in a news crawl. (I also just want to see Jimmi Simpson's Walton more, [especially considering how much thought he puts into his performance][EW interview].)
- They say that familiarity breeds contempt, and nothing seems to breed more of each than the things we recognize in ourselves emerging in others. The *real* nightmare would come if a service let us *extract* those undesirable qualities in ourselves for *direct antagonism*. (And who's to say that this isn't [essentially what parenting is already?][This Be the Verse])

It all fell into place when I thought about that lollipop Tommy had in *Callister*, and a story that my mom revealed to me as a teenager (after telling her about the episode of South Park where Kyle's mom has her play "ookie mouth" to catch Kenny's chicken pox) about how she had me lick the lollipop of another kid who had chicken pox. That image made me think of Tommy as a [Gattaca Baby][Designer Babies], who'd be given a lollipop to introduce CRISPR/Cas9 viral DNA rewriting "antibodies" to resolve one of the persistent ethical qualms people have had with the Gattaca concept (that it's inhumane to craft children whose DNA can become obsolete).

On top of that, I realized that the world of *Callister* is *already* a setting where the lines between DNA and consciousness have been blurred, and so it would make a *perfect* host for horrors like a scene where fertility specialists analyze your DNA for known regressions introduced in previous patches.

(This *also* calls out to one of the thoughts I've had about the episode *Arkangel*, that the most implausible speculative concept was that of a defunct company's network-connected product continuing to function after the startup that produced it inevitably closes its doors. Imagine if our culture of best-effort support - only providing updates for phones older than two years if it's not even *slightly* harder for them to do - were extended to *people*.)

I recognize that episodes of Black Mirror should stand alone, so this episode wouldn't have any *direct* reference to the plot of *USS Callister* (it *could* even be a prequel, though if you wanted the same child actor who played Tommy to star / cameo, that might not be feasible).

(On the subject of withdrawing support for human beings after they've aged out of their mandated support window: think about how we *already* have this attitude toward child stars, eg. Sarah Lynn on *BoJack Horseman*.)

The working title's a somewhat-unavoidable homage to *We Need To Talk About Kevin*, one that also brings to mind "let's talk turkey" and the idea of a sales pitch around the designer crafting of your children.

First draft to come.
