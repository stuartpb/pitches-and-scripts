# Mister Rogers

See [these tweets](https://twitter.com/stuartpb/status/864618838930866176). I feel as strongly about Fred Rogers deserving a Hollywood blockbuster biopic as Lin-Manuel Miranda felt about Alexander Hamilton deserving a Broadway hip-hopera.

> "How could someone be as happy as Mister Rogers?" He got to permanently make millions of people fundamentally better, for their whole lives.
