# Mister Rogers

See [these tweets](https://twitter.com/stuartpb/status/864618838930866176). I feel as strongly about Fred Rogers deserving a Hollywood blockbuster biopic as Lin-Manuel Miranda felt about Alexander Hamilton deserving a Broadway hip-hopera.

## Understanding the character of Fred Rogers

It's all there in the lyrics to "Won't You Be My Neighbor?":

> I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you,
>
> I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you.

Mister Rogers frequently addresses the viewer in his show as "you". It's easy to see this as just a corny, but it's coming from a place of *deep* sincerity. When Mister Rogers speaks to "you", he's speaking to *anybody who'd be watching*.

Fred Rogers wanted to meet *everybody*. The thing that gave his life meaning was to help by thouching the lives of others, and learning from their lives in turn.

## Fred's arc

If you've just got a hero who's great from the beginning and never struggles with anything inside themselves, you might have a story someone can *watch*, but you don't have a story someone can *feel*.

So, the arc of this movie (or miniseries or season of a cable drama about PBS or whatever) would start with a focus on something at which Fred Rogers was *weak*. This doesn't have to be something *overt*; it should just be a subtle detail., on which the plot *hinges*, to show how the protagonist is affected.

So, anyway, the idea here is that, while Mister Rogers was so comfortable and deft at interacting in a place of emotional sincerity with *children*, he isn't the most comfortable at performing in the convoluted, obtuse interactions of *adults*. For example, if someone ribs him with a light-hearted insult, his response would be to speak to the *intent of the speaker* - if it was well-intentioned, he might thank them for caring - but he'd never fit in by hitting *back*, the way that many adults would. This kind of sarcastic operation is just fundamentally not in his nature, and he blanches accordingly in environments where it's bandied about.

The *climax* of this film is a showdown, where the thing that Mister Rogers cares about most - his connection to the great "neighborhood" of all America's children, those who he can help the most, and those who understand him best - is threatened by the United States Senate Subcommittee on Communications, who are looking to cut the federal budget for public broadcasting in half. Such budget cuts would be fatal to *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*, which has already had to go door-to-door asking for donations to make ends meet.

To justify his budget, however, Fred Rogers must testify *directly* before the Subcommittee, in front of Senator John Pastore, an impatient former attorney who looks like a cross between Joe McCarthy and Groucho Marx. It's about a million miles away from the kind of person who listens intently when you ask them about how they're coming along at tying their shoes.

To justify a twenty-million-dollar public broadcasting budget, Fred has to leave his space of comfort and stand his ground against a room full of politicians, the most warped specimens of the adult world known to humanity. He must muster all his resolve and self-control to weather their gaze, while not betraying the values of honesty and sinceity that are so core to his being.

And in the space of six-and-a-half minutes, [he convinces them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKy7ljRr0AA). It's one of the most moving and plain-spoken speeches in American history, one that manages to give Senator Pastore "goosebumps" without an inch of grandstanding exaggerations or melodrama. It's *astonishingly* transformative, the kind of thing I struggle to perceive as *not* being the dramatic culmination of a great heroic narrative. And, not to put too fine a point on it, but it's something I feel a lot of personal aspiration to, and something where I lose sleep over the thought that this story could go unrecognized at large.
